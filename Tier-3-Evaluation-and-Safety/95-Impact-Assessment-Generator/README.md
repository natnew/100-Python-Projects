## 🧠 Mental Model

### The Problem
You built a "Resume Screening Agent".
It subtly discriminates against certain universities.
You deploy it. You get sued.
You should have done an **Impact Assessment**.

### The Solution
A **Pre-Deployment Risk Calculator**.
A structured questionnaire that evaluates:
1.  **Severity**: Critical infrastructure vs. Entertainment.
2.  **Scale**: 100 users vs. 1 Billion users.
3.  **Vulnerability**: Vulnerable populations involved?

### Architecture
1.  **Survey**: Interactive CLI inputs.
2.  **Scoring**: Weighted risk formula.
3.  **Tiering**: Low / Medium / High Risk.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   `Math` (Scoring).
*   CLI inputs.
