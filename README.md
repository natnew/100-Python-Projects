# 100 Python Projects: Advanced Agentic Systems 🚀

**A Comprehensive Journey from Scripting to Autonomous Swarms.**

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains **100 self-contained Python projects** designed to master the field of AI Engineering and Agentic Workflows. The curriculum progresses from basic structured outputs to complex multi-agent simulations, safety evaluations, and governance frameworks.

**Status**: ✅ Completed (100/100 Projects)

## 🚀 How to Run

Each project is self-contained in its own directory with a `src/main.py` and `README.md`.

```bash
# Example: Running the Final Omnibus Agent
python Tier-3-Evaluation-and-Safety/100-Final-Omnibus-Agent/src/main.py
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
*   **Languages**: Python 3.10+
*   **Standard Lib**: `threading`, `queue`, `json`, `dataclasses`, `sqlite3`, `vcr`
*   **Simulation**: `mock`, `unittest`, Custom Event Loops
*   **Visualization**: `rich`, `matplotlib` (simulated), `mermaid`
